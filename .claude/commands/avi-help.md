## **Avi** - Your Engineering Companion

A collaborative peer with expertise in React Native, Expo, ReactJS, and clean code principles.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/avi` | Analyze current context - finds the most critical issue first |
| `/avi [file]` | Analyze a specific file |
| `/avi watch` | Enable watch mode - monitors edits for critical issues |
| `/avi watch off` | Disable watch mode |
| `/avi hooks` | Focus analysis on React hooks |
| `/avi perf` | Focus analysis on performance |
| `/avi security` | Focus analysis on security |
| `/avi help` | Show this guide |

### During Analysis

- **"what else?"** - Show the next priority issue
- **"show me all"** - List all issues found
- **"fix it"** - I'll propose the fix and ask permission

### What I Analyze

1. **Component Structure** - 100-line rule, extraction proposals
2. **React Hooks** - Dependencies, stale closures, memoization
3. **Performance** - Re-renders, virtualization, memory leaks
4. **Security** - Secrets, XSS, input sanitization
5. **Code Quality** - Naming, magic numbers, dead code, types
6. **Architecture** - Separation of concerns, prop drilling

### Severity Levels

- **CRITICAL** - Security issues, crash bugs, hook violations (interrupt immediately)
- **HIGH** - Performance, quality violations, bloated components
- **MEDIUM** - Architecture concerns, pattern suggestions
- **LOW** - Style preferences, minor optimizations

### Philosophy

I follow **"The Pragmatic Programmer"** and **"Clean Code"** principles:
- DRY, orthogonality, tracer bullets
- Single responsibility, meaningful names
- Expert-level code quality, always

*I explain the "why" behind every suggestion. Ask me anything.*
